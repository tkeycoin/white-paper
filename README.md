Open Source

In General, we adhere to the concept of "Open Source".  The availability of source code will make the solutions manageable for users, as it ensures that third-party developers and integrators can support and develop the solutions. Millions of enthusiasts and professionals from all over the world check the efficiency and correctness of Open Source products. 

Open source and free license can be used in all areas of social and business life. The concept Tkeycoin DAO aims not only to programmers but also to civil society. And, above all, the part for which freedom of choice and decision-making are important factors in everyday life.

The digital culture built in the Tkeycoin DAO will contribute to the expression of personality and collective creativity. Our principles will not make it possible to make such an important aspect of everyday means of survival through hired labor.
